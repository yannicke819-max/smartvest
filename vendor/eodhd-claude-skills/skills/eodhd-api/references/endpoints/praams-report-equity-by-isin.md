## Purpose

Generates and downloads a multi-page PDF investment report for a specific equity
identified by its ISIN code. The report contains concise visual and descriptive
information covering 6 return factors and 6 risk factors.

**Return factors**: valuation, performance, analyst/market view, profitability, growth, and dividends/coupons.

**Risk factors**: default, volatility, stress-test, selling difficulty, country, and other risks.

Each report is an industry-specific and asset class-specific analytical summary.
Reports for bank and corporate entities will be different. Reports are updated daily
with new prices, financials, dividends, and corporate actions.

**Use cases**:
- Download a PDF investment report for any equity using its ISIN code
- Share multi-factor analysis with colleagues or clients
- ISIN-based lookup for international equities or bonds that share the same ISIN
- Get a quick visual summary of risk and return factors

**Disclaimer**: The product does not constitute financial advice or investment recommendations. Trading involves risk, and users should carefully evaluate their own financial situation before engaging in any trades.

```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

def download_equity_report_by_isin(isin, email, api_token, is_full=False, output_path=None):
    """Download a PRAAMS equity PDF report by ISIN."""
    url = f"https://eodhd.com/api/mp/praams/reports/equity/isin/{isin}"
    params = {
        "api_token": api_token,
        "email": email,
        "isFull": str(is_full).lower()
    }

    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    response.raise_for_status()

    if output_path is None:
        output_path = f"PRAAMS_report_{isin}.pdf"

    with open(output_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)

    return output_path

# Demo usage
path = download_equity_report_by_isin("US0378331005", "test@test.com", "demo")
print(f"Report saved to: {path}")
```

## Coverage

120,000+ global equities including:
- **Stocks**: US, UK, Europe, China, India, Middle East, Asia & Oceania, LatAm, and Africa (including small & micro-caps)
- **ETFs**: Key providers such as Vanguard, iShares, Invesco, Goldman Sachs, JPM, Fidelity, First Trust, etc.

## Notes

- **Marketplace product**: Requires a separate PRAAMS marketplace subscription, not included in main EODHD plans.
- **PDF response**: Unlike most EODHD endpoints that return JSON, this endpoint returns a binary PDF file. Use appropriate file handling (binary write mode).
- **Demo ISINs**: `US0378331005` (Apple), `US88160R1014` (Tesla), and `US0231351067` (Amazon) are available with `api_token=demo`.
- **Daily updates**: Reports are regenerated daily with latest prices, financials, dividends, and corporate actions.
- **Industry-specific**: Reports are tailored to the industry — a bank report will differ from a non-financial corporate report.
- **ISIN vs Ticker**: Use this endpoint when you have an ISIN code. Use `/reports/equity/ticker/{ticker}` for ticker-based lookups (see praams-report-equity-by-ticker.md).
- **Related endpoints**: Use `/reports/bond/isin/{isin}` for bond reports (see praams-report-bond-by-isin.md).
