Path: `/reports/equity/ticker/{ticker}`
Method: GET
Auth: `api_token` query parameter
Response: PDF file download

## Purpose

Generates and downloads a multi-page PDF investment report for a specific equity
identified by its ticker symbol. The report contains concise visual and descriptive
information covering 6 return factors and 6 risk factors.

**Return factors**: valuation, performance, analyst/market view, profitability, growth, and dividends/coupons.

**Risk factors**: default, volatility, stress-test, selling difficulty, country, and other risks.

Each report is an industry-specific and asset class-specific analytical summary.
Reports for bank and corporate entities will be different. Reports are updated daily
with new prices, financials, dividends, and corporate actions.

**Use cases**:
- Download a PDF investment report on any equity for offline reading
- Share multi-factor analysis with colleagues or clients
- Get a quick visual summary of risk and return factors
- Industry-specific analysis (bank reports differ from corporate reports)

**Disclaimer**: The product does not constitute financial advice or investment recommendations. Trading involves risk, and users should carefully evaluate their own financial situation before engaging in any trades.

### Python Example

```python
import requests

def download_equity_report_by_ticker(ticker, email, api_token, is_full=False, output_path=None):
    """Download a PRAAMS equity PDF report by ticker."""
    url = f"https://eodhd.com/api/mp/praams/reports/equity/ticker/{ticker}"
    params = {
        "api_token": api_token,
        "email": email,
        "isFull": str(is_full).lower()
    }

    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    response.raise_for_status()

    if output_path is None:
        output_path = f"PRAAMS_report_{ticker}.pdf"

    with open(output_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)

    return output_path

# Demo usage
path = download_equity_report_by_ticker("AAPL", "test@test.com", "demo")
print(f"Report saved to: {path}")
```

## Coverage

120,000+ global equities including:
- **Stocks**: US, UK, Europe, China, India, Middle East, Asia & Oceania, LatAm, and Africa (including small & micro-caps)
- **ETFs**: Key providers such as Vanguard, iShares, Invesco, Goldman Sachs, JPM, Fidelity, First Trust, etc.

## Notes

- **Marketplace product**: Requires a separate PRAAMS marketplace subscription, not included in main EODHD plans.
- **PDF response**: Unlike most EODHD endpoints that return JSON, this endpoint returns a binary PDF file. Use appropriate file handling (binary write mode).
- **Demo tickers**: `AAPL`, `TSLA`, and `AMZN` are available with `api_token=demo`.
- **Daily updates**: Reports are regenerated daily with latest prices, financials, dividends, and corporate actions.
- **Industry-specific**: Reports are tailored to the industry — a bank report will differ from a non-financial corporate report.
- **Related endpoints**: Use `/reports/equity/isin/{isin}` for ISIN-based equity reports (see praams-report-equity-by-isin.md). Use `/reports/bond/isin/{isin}` for bond reports (see praams-report-bond-by-isin.md).
