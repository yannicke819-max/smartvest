## Example Requests

```bash
# All recent insider transactions
curl "https://eodhd.com/api/insider-transactions?api_token=demo&fmt=json"

# Insider transactions for specific company
curl "https://eodhd.com/api/insider-transactions?code=AAPL.US&api_token=demo&fmt=json"

# Transactions for date range

```

## Notes

- Insider transactions are filed with SEC within 2 business days (Form 4)
- `transactionCode` 'P' (purchase) and 'S' (sale) are most significant for sentiment
- Large purchases by multiple insiders may signal confidence
- Scheduled sales (10b5-1 plans) are less meaningful than discretionary sales
- `transactionPrice` may be null for stock grants, awards, or gifts
- Use `postTransactionAmount` to see total insider holdings
- Required fields: code, ownerName, transactionDate, transactionCode, transactionAmount
- API call consumption: 1 call per request
- **Coverage**: Data is available for the **past year** for **US companies only**, sourced from SEC Form 4 filings. Non-US markets are not covered.

## HTTP Status Codes

The API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

| Status Code | Meaning | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **200** | OK | Request succeeded. Data returned successfully. |
| **402** | Payment Required | API limit used up. Upgrade plan or wait for limit reset. |
| **403** | Unauthorized | Invalid API key. Check your `api_token` parameter. |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | Exceeded rate limit (requests per minute). Slow down requests. |

### Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the API returns a JSON response with error details:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message description",
  "code": 403
}
```

### Handling Errors

**Python Example**:
```python
import requests

def make_api_request(url, params):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for bad status codes
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        if e.response.status_code == 402:
            print("Error: API limit exceeded. Please upgrade your plan.")
        elif e.response.status_code == 403:
            print("Error: Invalid API key. Check your credentials.")
        elif e.response.status_code == 429:
            print("Error: Rate limit exceeded. Please slow down your requests.")
        else:
            print(f"HTTP Error: {e}")
        return None
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Request failed: {e}")
        return None
```

**Best Practices**:
- Always check status codes before processing response data
- Implement exponential backoff for 429 errors
- Cache responses to reduce API calls
- Monitor your API usage in the user dashboard
