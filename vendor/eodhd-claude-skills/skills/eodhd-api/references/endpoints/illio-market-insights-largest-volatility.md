## Notes

- **Marketplace product**: Requires a separate illio marketplace subscription, not included in main EODHD plans.
- **URL path is `/volume/`**: Despite being a volatility endpoint, the URL path uses `/volume/{id}`.
- **100-day volatility**: The change is measured as the absolute difference in 100-day rolling volatility over the past year.
- **Two buckets**: Instruments are split into "Volatility Increase" and "Volatility Decrease" groups.
- **Stats detail from/to**: The stats text includes the starting and ending volatility values for the largest movers.
- **Sorted by magnitude**: Instruments within each bucket are sorted by the size of their volatility change (largest first).
- **Supported indices**: S&P 500 (`SnP500`), Dow Jones (`DJI`), Nasdaq-100 (`NDX`).
- **Disclaimer**: Data does not constitute financial advice or investment recommendations.
